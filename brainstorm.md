REST is a set of principles that define how web standards, such as HTTP, should be used to create web services. A RESTful API is an API that adheres to these principles. The main principles of REST are:

- **Client-Server Architecture:** The client and server are separate entities that communicate with each other through a well-defined API. This separation of concerns allows for independent development and scaling of the client and server.
- **Statelessness:** The server does not store any client context between requests. Each request from the client must contain all the information necessary to understand and process the request. This makes the API more scalable and reliable.
- **Cacheability:** The server can indicate whether a response is cacheable or not. This allows the client to cache responses, which can improve performance and reduce the load on the server.
- **Uniform Interface:** The API should have a uniform interface that is easy to understand and use. This includes using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.
- **Layered System:** The architecture can be composed of multiple layers, with each layer having a specific responsibility. This allows for a more modular and scalable architecture.

By designing the API to be RESTful, the platform will have a well-structured, scalable, and easy-to-use API that can be consumed by a variety of clients, including web browsers, mobile apps, and other web services.

A relational database, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, is the recommended choice for this tier due to its ability to handle structured data and enforce data integrity through relationships and constraints. The database will be designed with a well-defined schema that accurately represents the entities and their relationships within the system. For example, there will be tables for `Roles`, `Levels`, `Topics`, `Questions`, and `Roadmaps`. The `Questions` table will have foreign keys to the `Topics` and `Roles` tables, establishing a clear relationship between a question and its associated topic and role. This structured approach ensures that the data is organized, consistent, and easy to query.

The database will be designed to be scalable and performant. Proper indexing will be used to optimize query performance, especially for frequently accessed data. For example, indexes will be created on the `role_id` and `level_id` columns in the `Roadmaps` table to speed up the retrieval of roadmaps for a specific role and level. The database will also be designed to be resilient to failures, with regular backups and a disaster recovery plan in place. In addition to the primary relational database, an in-memory cache, such as Redis, may be used to improve performance. The cache can be used to store frequently accessed data, such as the list of available roles or the most popular questions, reducing the load on the database and improving the response time of the API. The data in the database will be managed by the backend API, which will use an ORM to interact with the database in a more abstract and intuitive way. This separation of concerns ensures that the database is not directly exposed to the frontend, which improves the security and maintainability of the system.
